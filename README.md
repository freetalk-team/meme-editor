## In Loving Memory of Marina Nedeva ðŸ’–

| ![Picture of Marina](public/ui/png/marina.png) | This project is dedicated to the memory of Marina, my dearest friend, an extraordinary software developer, and a kind, inspiring soul who left an indelible mark on both this work and my life. <br><br> Her contributions to this project showcase her dedication to clean code, her problem-solving skills, and her commitment to excellence. Her friendship and professional brilliance will always be remembered. |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Her Contribution

Marina was not just a collaborator; she was the heart of many of our ideas and innovations. Her exceptional skills in software development, her dedication to clean, efficient code, and her keen problem-solving abilities elevated every project we worked on together. 

She was more than a teammate; she was a visionary who approached every challenge with creativity and determination. Many features and functionalities of this project are a testament to her talent and perseverance. Her ability to simplify complex concepts and her passion for sharing knowledge made her an invaluable mentor and partner.

### Her Spirit

Beyond her technical brilliance, Marina was a source of light and positivity. She had a way of turning late-night coding sessions into cherished memories, filled with laughter, insight, and encouragement. Her kindness, patience, and empathy touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing her.

To me, she was not just a friend but a sister in spirit. She believed in lifting others up, celebrating their successes, and always pushing for excellence in everything she did.

### A Legacy of Friendship and Excellence

Though her time with us was far too short, Marina leaves behind a legacy of dedication, innovation, and friendship. This project, and so many others we collaborated on, are a reflection of her love for technology and her desire to make the world a better place through her work.

I hope that as you use and contribute to this project, you feel a sense of the passion and joy that she poured into it. Her work will continue to inspire and guide us, just as her friendship will always remain in our hearts.

May her memory live on through the code she crafted, the ideas she brought to life, and the lives she touched. ðŸ’–
