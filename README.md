### Her Contribution

Marina was not just a collaborator; she was the heart of many of our ideas and innovations. Her exceptional skills in software development, her dedication to clean, efficient code, and her keen problem-solving abilities elevated every project we worked on together. 

She was more than a teammate; she was a visionary who approached every challenge with creativity and determination. Many features and functionalities of this project are a testament to her talent and perseverance. Her ability to simplify complex concepts and her passion for sharing knowledge made her an invaluable mentor and partner.

### Her Spirit

Beyond her technical brilliance, Marina was a source of light and positivity. She had a way of turning late-night coding sessions into cherished memories, filled with laughter, insight, and encouragement. Her kindness, patience, and empathy touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing her.

To me, she was not just a friend but a sister in spirit. She believed in lifting others up, celebrating their successes, and always pushing for excellence in everything she did.
